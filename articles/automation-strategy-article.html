What are we trying to solve? That is the only thing you must be able to answer before starting.<p>The result? Several high-profile AI and ML deployments have failed due to poor planning, strategy, and execution:<ul class="icon-list"><li><span class="icon">🛑</span> <strong>Cancelled AI Project:</strong> A $4B cancer treatment AI project was halted due to reliance on poor data, lack of adaptability, and unsafe recommendations.<li><span class="icon">📉</span> <strong>Loss in Real Estate AI:</strong> An AI home buying tool led to a $304M loss, highlighting issues with price prediction failures and absent market testing.<li><span class="icon">📊</span> <strong>High Failure Rate:</strong> 70% of AI projects fail due to rushed implementation and lack of readiness assessments.<li><span class="icon">📉</span> <strong>Data Issues:</strong> Many AI models fail because they rely on poor or irrelevant data.<li><span class="icon">📉</span> <strong>Scalability Problems:</strong> System efficiency is hampered by scalability and integration issues.<li><span class="icon">🔄</span> <strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Inadequate resource allocation results in stalled AI initiatives.<li><span class="icon">🌍</span> <strong>Contextual Challenges:</strong> AI often struggles to adapt to local contexts, reducing its effectiveness.<li><span class="icon">⚠</span> <strong>Need for Planning:</strong> These failures illustrate the necessity for comprehensive planning, realistic expectations, and rigorous testing.<li><span class="icon">🔧</span> <strong>Tool, Not a Solution:</strong> The recurring failures highlight the importance of viewing technology as a tool serving a strategic purpose, not as an all-encompassing solution.</ul></section><section class="article-section"><h2 class="section-title icon-title"><span class="icon">🔥</span> Why Execution, Not Automation, Defines the Future</h2><p>Too often, businesses deploy technology without first defining the objective, constraints, or desired outcome.
