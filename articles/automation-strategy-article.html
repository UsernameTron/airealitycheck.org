        <p>For years, companies have equated speed with progress—automating at scale without first defining the problem. What are we trying to solve? That is the only thing you must be able to answer before starting.</p>
        
        <p>The result? Several high-profile AI and ML deployments have failed due to poor planning, strategy, and execution:</p>
        
        <ul class="icon-list">
          <li><span class="icon">🛑</span> <strong>Cancelled AI Project:</strong> A $4B cancer treatment AI project was halted due to reliance on poor data, lack of adaptability, and unsafe recommendations.</li>
          <li><span class="icon">📉</span> <strong>Loss in Real Estate AI:</strong> An AI home buying tool led to a $304M loss, highlighting issues with price prediction failures and absent market testing.</li>
          <li><span class="icon">📊</span> <strong>High Failure Rate:</strong> 70% of AI projects fail due to rushed implementation and lack of readiness assessments.</li>
          <li><span class="icon">📉</span> <strong>Data Issues:</strong> Many AI models fail because they rely on poor or irrelevant data.</li>
          <li><span class="icon">📉</span> <strong>Scalability Problems:</strong> System efficiency is hampered by scalability and integration issues.</li>
          <li><span class="icon">🔄</span> <strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Inadequate resource allocation results in stalled AI initiatives.</li>
          <li><span class="icon">🌍</span> <strong>Contextual Challenges:</strong> AI often struggles to adapt to local contexts, reducing its effectiveness.</li>
          <li><span class="icon">⚠</span> <strong>Need for Planning:</strong> These failures illustrate the necessity for comprehensive planning, realistic expectations, and rigorous testing.</li>
          <li><span class="icon">🔧</span> <strong>Tool, Not a Solution:</strong> The recurring failures highlight the importance of viewing technology as a tool serving a strategic purpose, not as an all-encompassing solution.</li>

        <h2 class="section-title icon-title"><span class="icon">🔥</span> Why Execution, Not Automation, Defines the Future</h2>
        <p>Too often, businesses deploy technology without first defining the objective, constraints, or desired outcome. Execution must be intentional, precise, and adaptable—not reactive.</p>

      <!-- Section 3 -->
      <section class="article-section">
        <h2 class="section-title icon-title"><span class="icon">🔥</span> The Enterprise Shift: Orchestration Over Automation</h2>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p><strong>Define First, Deploy Second</strong> → Strategy before technology. Execution starts with clarity, not code.</p>
          <p><strong>Orchestration Wins Over Automation</strong> → Systems must work together, not operate in isolation.</p>
          <p><strong>Execution Over Speed</strong> → Moving fast in the wrong direction only accelerates failure.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Soft costs and hidden costs built into one-size-fits-all engagements are always there. Strategy + insights = success.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title icon-title"><span class="icon">🔥</span> I am Participating in a Movement vs. Being Thrilled to Announce</h2>
        
        <p><span class="icon">🤖</span> Challenging the one-size-fits-all approach to automation for years. Effective next week, I am aligning with a firm that values strategic execution and intentional technology use.</p>
        
        <p><span class="icon">🎯</span> The future belongs to those who execute with precision; all else risks accelerating failure.</p>

        <p>Executives, decision makers, and strategists—you've seen automation fail when strategy wasn't the starting point.</p>
